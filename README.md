# Relevance-Guided-Masking-for-CI

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for the ICCV 2025 Workshop paper: **"Relevance-Guided Activation Sparsification for Bandwidth-Efficient Collaborative Inference"**.

## ðŸš€ Installation

We recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to ensure a clean installation. The code has been tested with Python 3.8+.


**1. Install all dependencies** with a single command:

```bash
pip install nncodec
pip install zennit-crp
```

You are now ready to run the example segmentation experiments with:

```bash
python3 segmentation.py
```
